![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad3d97c7-72ed-46db-991b-6e38d27c350d)



This project analyzes **pizza sales data** to uncover key business insights using **SQL** for querying and **Power BI** for visualization. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of sales performance across different dimensions like pizza categories, slice types, weekdays/months, and total revenue.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:

- **Total Revenue** and **Total Orders**
- Sales **by Pizza Category** (e.g., Classic, Veggie, Supreme)
- Sales breakdown **by Pizza Slice Size**
- **Monthly** and **Daily** Sales Trends
- Top-selling Pizzas based on order volume and revenue
- Filtering options for better user interaction

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **SQL** (for querying and preprocessing data)
- **Power BI Desktop** (for building the visual dashboard)
- **PostgreSQL / Any RDBMS** (for database management)
- **CSV or relational data sources** (used to import pizza sales data)

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Certain pizza categories outperform others consistently across months.
- Sales trends vary by day of the week — with spikes on weekends.
- Medium and large-sized pizzas are top contributors to revenue.
- Monthly sales can highlight peak seasons or promotional impact.
